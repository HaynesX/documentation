## Overview

HyperRaidBot offers flexible pricing options to suit your needs:
1. **Free Tier** - Basic quotas for standard groups
2. **Pro Tier** - Enhanced quotas and exclusive features
3. **Add-ons** - Pay-as-you-go credits for additional capacity

### Free Tier Quotas

| Feature | Monthly Quota | Reset Period |
| ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Raids | 1,500 | Monthly |
| OpenAI SmartReply Generations | 10 | Monthly |

<Info>
  Monthly quotas reset at the beginning of each month for Free Groups.
</Info>

## ⭐️ Pro Tier (30 Days)

### Enhanced Quotas

| Feature | Free Tier | Pro Tier | Reset Period |
| ------- | --------- | -------- | ------------ |
| Raids | 1,500 | 4,500 | Monthly |
| OpenAI SmartReply Generations | 10 | 15,000 | Monthly |

### Exclusive Features
Pro Tier unlocks premium features that aren't available with Add-ons:

- **[AutoRaid](/autoraid/overview)** - Automatically raid new tweets from specified KOLs.
- **[Leaderboard](/leaderboard/overview)** - Track and display top raiders in your group
- **[Exports](/exports/overview)** - Download detailed raid analytics and statistics

<Note>
Purchasing multiple Pro Tiers extends the duration but **DOES NOT stack the quotas.** For example:
- Buying 3x Pro Tier = 90 days of Pro benefits
- Quotas remain at 4,500 raids and 15,000 generations per month
- Quotas still reset monthly
</Note>

## Pay-as-you-go Add-ons

Add-ons provide additional capacity when monthly quotas are exhausted. They never expire and work for both Free and Pro tier groups.

| Add-on | Capacity |
| ------ | -------- |
| Additional Raids | 1,500 raids |
| Additional SmartReply Generations | 7,500 generations |

### How Add-ons Work

1. Add-ons only get consumed after your monthly quota is exhausted
2. They never expire until used
3. Can be purchased anytime via `/pro`
4. Work alongside both Free and Pro tier quotas

### Example Scenario

Let's say a Pro tier group has:
- Monthly quota: 4,500 raids
- Purchased add-on: 1,500 raids

If they use 5,000 raids in a month:
- 4,500 raids come from their monthly Pro quota
- 500 raids come from their add-on balance
- 1,000 raids remain in their add-on balance
- Next month, they start fresh with 4,500 monthly raids again.
- Add-ons are never reset, so they can be used again next month if quota is exhausted again.

## Managing Your Subscription

Use the `/pro` command to:
- View current quotas and usage
- Check subscription status and expiry
- Purchase Pro tier or Add-ons
- Monitor Add-on balances

<Warning>
When Pro tier expires, groups return to Free tier quotas (1,500 raids and 10 generations per month).
</Warning>
