## Set a Default X Account via `/link`
1. Once on the `/link` page, you can view all the X Accounts that are linked to your TG by pressing the `[View Linked Accounts üîó]` button.
2. Next, (assuming you have more than one X Account linked), press the <Icon icon="ellipsis-vertical" /> button next to the X Account you want to set as default.
3. Press the `[Set as Default]` button.
4. Congratulations! You've now set a new Default X Account for your TG account.

<Info>
Setting a Default X Account means that any button presses made on active raids, such as pressing the `‚ù§Ô∏è` button (which likes the tweet being raided), it will be made using the Default X Account.
