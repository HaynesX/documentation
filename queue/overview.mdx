{/* Let's explore the key **Terminology** and raid types in Hyper. The bot supports three distinct types of raids:
- **Standard Raids**: Raids made via the `/raid` command are the core function of Hyper, and often referred to as "Standard Raids". It allows you to start or queue a raid with a single command by providing a URL of the tweet you want to raid, and you can configure it to your desired settings. **This section will cover how to use the `/raid` command.**
- **SmartReply Raids**: Raids made via SmartReply are the second type of raid. If enabled, admins can AI-generate a Reply to a tweet which is currently being raided. Once the AI-generated reply is posted on X (via a Linked X Account), the reply will be raided and overrwrite (cancel) the current raid. To understand how SmartReply works, read the [SmartReply](/smartreply) section.
- **AutoRaid Raids (PRO)**: Raids made via AutoRaid are the third type of raid. It allows you to add KOLs that are scanned every minute on X for new Tweets which will be automatically raided when they are detected. To understand how AutoRaid works, read the [AutoRaid](/autoraid) section. */}

### Queue Management

You can manage the queue via the `/queue` command. Raids added to the queue via /raid or AutoRaid will be started in the order they were added after every raid has finished.
- **Reorder Queue**: Easily reorder the queue by dragging and dropping raids using the UI.
- **Force Start**: Force start a raid in the queue, even if it's not the first position.
- **Remove from Queue**: Remove a raid from the queue with ease.
- **Preview Tweet**: Preview the tweet that will be raided before it's executed.
- **Clear Queue**: Clear the entire queue.
