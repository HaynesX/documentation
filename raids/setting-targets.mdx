### Modifying Targets on an Active Raid
Targets can be modified by clicking the `[Set Targets ðŸŽ¯]` button in the setup menu when a raid is being set up via `/raid`. 

This will open the Targets page in the Mini App where you can modify the targets for each engagement type, as well as enable/disable them, change the target mode, and set defaults.

### Target Modes
Understand the differences between Dynamic & Fixed Target Modes.

**Dynamic Target Mode**
> Dynamic Target Mode is the default mode for raids. This mode **adds** your target numbers to the tweet's current metrics.

| Current Likes | Your Target | Final Goal |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| 100 | +50 | 150 likes |



**Fixed Target Mode**
> Fixed Target Mode is a mode which allows you to set an exact target number of engagements, regardless of the tweet's current metrics.

| Current Likes | Your Target | Final Goal |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------- |
| 100 | 125 | 125 likes |


<Warning>Popular tweets may end a Raid prematurely if fixed targets are not high enough.</Warning>

### Change Target Mode
By pressing the **Toggle**, you can switch between Dynamic & Fixed Target Modes.

### Engagements
You can set a target for each of the below engagements, as well as enable/disable them.

- Likes
- Retweets
- Bookmarks
- Replies

Disabling an engagement will prevent it from being engaged on via the buttons in the chat, however, it saves space in the chat as the indicator will not be shown in the raid message.



### Set Defaults (Standard Raids)
By pressing the **Set Defaults** button, this will set the Standard Raids targets to the values you have set in the Targets page. 
<Info>
This will only affect Standard Raids. This does not affect AutoRaid & SmartReply Targets.
