{/* Let's explore the key **Terminology** and raid types in Hyper. The bot supports three distinct types of raids:
- **Standard Raids**: Raids made via the `/raid` command are the core function of Hyper, and often referred to as "Standard Raids". It allows you to start or queue a raid with a single command by providing a URL of the tweet you want to raid, and you can configure it to your desired settings. **This section will cover how to use the `/raid` command.**
- **SmartReply Raids**: Raids made via SmartReply are the second type of raid. If enabled, admins can AI-generate a Reply to a tweet which is currently being raided. Once the AI-generated reply is posted on X (via a Linked X Account), the reply will be raided and overrwrite (cancel) the current raid. To understand how SmartReply works, read the [SmartReply](/smartreply) section.
- **AutoRaid Raids (PRO)**: Raids made via AutoRaid are the third type of raid. It allows you to add KOLs that are scanned every minute on X for new Tweets which will be automatically raided when they are detected. To understand how AutoRaid works, read the [AutoRaid](/autoraid) section. */}

### Raid Management

Raids made using the `/raid` command is a core function of Hyper. It allows you to start or queue a raid, and configure it to your desired settings.
- **Modify Targets**: Adjust the engagement targets (or defaults) for raids, such as the number of likes, retweets, replies, bookmarks, switch the target mode, and enable/disable them as you see fit, achieved by clicking the **Set Targets button** in the raid setup menu.
- **Adding to Queue**: Easily add a raid to your raid queue by clicking the **Queue button** in the raid setup menu. This will add the raid to the queue and start raids in the order they were added after every raid has finished.
- **Cancelling Raids**: You can cancel an ongoing raid by using the `/cancel` command, or cancel a raid setup by clicking the **Cancel button** in the setup menu.
