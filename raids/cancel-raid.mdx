## Cancel a Raid with `/cancel`
Cancelling a raid will quickly stop the raid, and attempt to dequeue another raid from the queue.
<Info>
Cancelled Raids still count towards your raid limits. Any engagements made on the raid up to the point of cancellation will still be counted and viewable in the leaderboard and in exports.
