## DeepReply

### What is DeepReply?
DeepReply is an advanced way to reply to tweets on X that redirects you to the native X app (or website on desktop) instead of using X's API (via QuickReply). This provides several key advantages:

- **More Organic Engagement**: Replies appear more natural to X's algorithm since they're not sent via API
- **Enhanced Customization**: Access to all native X features including video attachments
- **Higher Reply Limits**: Based on your X Premium Tier subscription
- **Increased Security**: Direct interaction through X's official app
- **Reliable Backup**: Alternative option when QuickReplying encounters API limitations

Once a DeepReply is sent by a user, Hyper automatically scans X for the reply posted by the user (for 3 minutes max). If the reply is found, the user will be notified that their DeepReply was successful. If not, the user will be able to reply again.

<Note>
DeepReply is a premium feature that uses your [DeepReply Quota](/pro/pricing-and-quotas#free-tier-quotas), as tracking replies made outside the X API involves continuous monitoring of X's platform. Any attempts made, whether the reply was found or not, will be deducted from your DeepReply Quota / Add-on Balance.
