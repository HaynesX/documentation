## Send DeepReply on Active Raids
By clicking the `[ðŸ’¬]` Button on an active raid, you can send a DeepReply once on the Reply page.

<Warning>
  The group must have DeepReply enabled and have enough DeepReply Quota/Add-on Balance. If not, you will not see the button to DeepReply, just QuickReply.
</Warning>

### Instructions

1. While a raid is active, click the `[ðŸ’¬]` Button.
2. This will open the Reply page.
3. Press the `Deep Reply on X` button.
4. You will be redirected to the X app (or website on desktop) to send the DeepReply.
5. Once the DeepReply is sent, you can return to the HyperRaidBot and see the reply (after a 1-3 minutes).
