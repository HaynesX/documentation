## Generate SmartReplies on Active Raids
By clicking the `[âœ¨]` Button on an active raid, you can generate SmartReplies.

<Warning>
  You MUST have a [SmartReply Context](/smartreply/create-smartreply-context) setup before you can generate SmartReplies.
</Warning>

### Instructions

1. While a raid is active, click the `[âœ¨]` Button.
2. This will open the SmartReply Generation page. (Only admins can generate SmartReplies).
3. Press the `[Generate SmartReplies]` button, and optionally fine-tune the reply generation. 
4. 3 SmartReplies will be generated. You can now click one of the SmartReplies.
5. Clicking on a SmartReply will populate the Reply Text Box with the SmartReply. You can now optionally edit and add media to the SmartReply before sending it. 
6. (Optionally) You can also add **Shared Chat Media** which allow everyone in the group (admins and users) to use when sending replies or smartreplies.
7. At the bottom of the page, you can either select to send from your Personal, Linked X Account, or Shared X Account if one is setup.
8. Once you're happy with the SmartReply, press the `[Send SmartReply]` button to send the SmartReply to the raided tweet.
9. **A raid will now launch** once the SmartReply is sent! ðŸŽ‰
