## SmartReply

### What is SmartReply?
SmartReply is a feature that allows you to AI-Generate suggested replies to the tweet that is currently being raided. SmartReplies are generated by an AI LLM, and can be customised to your liking. 

**Once a SmartReply is sent by an admin, it will automatically launch a new raid of that sent SmartReply.**

- **Edit SmartReply Context**: Edit a SmartReply Context to be used for SmartReply Generation.
